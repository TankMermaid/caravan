caravan
=======

Caravan is a fork of SmileTrain that I made in order to
* rework the command-line interface
* change in the intermediate file types (into yaml)
* change the submission style (to explictly use ssub)
* move simple functions to quick perl tools

## caravan requirements
caravan is developed against Python 2.7.3 and Perl 5.10.1.

## Documentation
Documents are in the github wiki.

## Tests
Unit tests are in the `test` folder. You can run the tests from the top directory 
by running `py.test` or `make`.
